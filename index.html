                    <p>My name is Brianna Gabriella Kelsey, born 3 months premature on June 1, 1993 at 2PM. My parents
                            named me Brianna, which means strong and virtuous. They knew their preemie was a fighter. Gabriella,
                            after the nurse Bella, who took care of me while I was still developing in the hospital. I'm all brain,
                            and equally heart. Conflicting, right?</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I love to laugh, 90's standup specials are the best! I also like cheesy sitcoms such as "The Mindy
                            Project," "The Golden Girls," and "Baby Daddy." Reading is key, and my Kindle is life. At least when I
                            have the time. As for movies I'm a fan of, "Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella (1997)," "The
                            Hangover," and "The Proposal," Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are hilarious. 
                            I also like espionage, action and movies with a good car chasing scene.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In 2016 I graduated with my bachelors degree. The following year I moved to New York to pursue my
                            career as a Graphic Designer. Two years later, I'm taking another leap of Faith to continue my
                            education, as a web developer. I'm still not sure if that's the correct term. I've heard software
                            engineer, software developer, web application developer, react, sitecore, UI, salesforce, angular,
                            python, Java developer, and many many more terms. Am I the only one with this question? I'm looking
                            forward to this iceberg of Knowledge that I'll be receiving within the next 6-months.
                            <br> I can do it, and you can too!</p>
